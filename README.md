# To Do:
- Reproduce algorithm using scikit learn
  - Algorithm from article is slow and doesn't seem very accurate.
  - use sklearn (piplines,cv gridsearch)
- Summarize the Medium article and explain how the algorithm work

# Files
1. transform_data.ipynb - Notebook used to modify original source data into the data used for this project
1. binary_classification.ipynb - Notebook using the binary classification algorithm from Medium article
